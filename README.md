# Floating Chat Widget

A lightweight, embeddable floating chat widget built with vanilla JavaScript, designed for modern web applications that need guided conversations, lead capture, and backend-powered chat without framework overhead.

This project emphasizes clean state management, predictable UI behavior, and easy extensibility.

---

## Overview

The Floating Chat Widget provides a reusable chat interface that can be embedded into any website. It supports menu-based interactions, contact workflows, and free-text conversations routed to a backend API.

The entire widget is implemented **without external libraries**, making it fast, portable, and easy to understand.

---

## Key Features

- 💬 Floating chat button with open and close behavior
- 🪟 Expandable and collapsible chat window
- 🗂️ Menu-driven conversation flow
- ⚡ Quick reply buttons for common actions
- 📧 Lead capture flow (name and email)
- 🤖 Free-form chat with backend API integration
- 🧩 Simple, readable state-based logic
- 🚫 No frameworks or dependencies

---

## Conversation Architecture

The chatbot operates using a **state-driven conversation model**. Each user interaction updates a single source of truth: `conversationState`.

```
MENU
 ├── INFO (Pricing / Features)
 │     └── Contact Prompt
 ├── CONTACT
 │     ├── ASK_NAME
 │     └── ASK_EMAIL
 └── FREE_CHAT
```

This approach avoids deeply nested conditionals and makes future extensions straightforward.

### Folder Breakdown

#### `frontend/`
Contains the complete chatbot UI:
- DOM creation
- State handling
- User interaction logic
- API communication

#### `backend/`
Reserved for server-side logic (e.g. FastAPI, Node.js).  
Currently tracked using `.gitkeep` until backend code is added.

## How It Works

1. User clicks the floating chat button
2. Chat window opens with main menu options
3. User selects a menu option or types a message
4. Conversation state updates accordingly
5. For free chat, the message is sent to a backend API
6. Bot response is rendered dynamically in the UI

All UI updates are handled **programmatically** for full control.

---

## Backend API Integration

Free-text messages are sent to a configurable backend endpoint.

### Endpoint
```
POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/chat
```

### Request Payload
```json
{
  "message": "User input text"
}
```

### Response Payload
```json
{
  "reply": "Bot response text"
}
```

This backend can be powered by:
- FastAPI
- Node.js
- AI / LLM services
- Rule-based chat engines
